    title: 'Washington State Casinos Help Drug Gangs Launder Money',
    text: 'Two members of a violent drug-trafficking ring — accused of laundering more than $1 million of meth, heroin, and fentanyl profits through Washington State casinos — were sent to prison this week by a federal judge. In a US District Court in Seattle, Jose Arrondondo-Valdez, 27, aka “Primo,” received a nine-year sentence on drug trafficking charges. Yvette Olguin, 40, was given 30 months in prison for money laundering conspiracy. Arrondondo-Valdez and Olguin are, respectively, the cousin and spouse of the alleged ringleader of the group, Cesar Valdez-Sanudo. He was sentenced to 15 years in January for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime. Arrondondo-Valdez was Valdez-Sanudo’s right-hand man, according to prosecutors. The pair were arrested together at the Snoqualmie Casino, east of Seattle, where they planned to confront a gang member who owed a drug debt. Investigators found three loaded guns, one equipped with a homemade silencer, inside their vehicle.',
